Hello there.

My name is Babatunde Adisa.
I am a Business Intelligence Consultant from Nigeria wishing to start a career in Data Engineering.
My key strengths are SQL, programming and critical thinking.

However, I am open to unlearn, learn and relearn all technologies.
I am unsatiable when it comes to learning.

Welcome to my world!
